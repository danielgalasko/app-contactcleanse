# Contact Cleanse Privacy Policy

Your privacy is extremely important to me and protecting it is paramount within my App ecosystem.

This page is used to inform users of Contact Cleanse regarding the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this Service, the Contact Cleanse App.

If you choose to use this Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that is collected is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## What data is collected and how is it used?

Contact Cleanse does not collect or store ANY data about your contacts outside of your device. All data is stored exclusively on your device.
Contact Cleanse does not send any information up to any server that contains any information that can identify you or your contacts. 
Anonymized data regarding App Installs and monetary analytics is collected and is explained [here](#3rd-party-services).

## What is stored on device?

On your device, Contact Cleanse will store a list of identifiers for contacts you have chosen to delete. 
These ID numbers are only recognisable by the iOS system and cannot be used by a human to interpret the contact or any information about it at all. As an example; a contact called John Doe, could be stored as E94CD15C-7964-4A9B-8AC4-10D7CFB791FD. Contact Cleanse stores the minimum possible information it needs to read contacts. The source of truth all data is derived from is the iOS Contacts App. This minimizes errors.

## 3rd Party Services

Contact Cleanse only uses analytics retrieved from Apple when you grant permission to share analytics with developers. None of this data personally identifies any users. The data we have is only helpful in understanding how much revenue is being generated and how many users use the App. You can read more here https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/analytics/

You can find Apple's privacy policy [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

## Data Retention/Deletion Policy

The App data is retained as long as you still have contacts you have flagged for deletion. Once you have deleted flagged contacts they will not be stored anymore. Should you wish to remove this data without deleting you may tap the Reset button or simply delete the App.

Analytics data is not personally identifiable to any user so it cannot be deleted. All analytics is completely anonymized.
